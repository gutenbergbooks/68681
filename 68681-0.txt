FOREWORD BY THE PUBLISHERS


One Cross Word Puzzle Book leads to another.

Now that the second volume, containing a new series of fifty more Cross
Word Puzzles, is available, it seems fitting to take the reader behind
the scenes and give him a short history of this cross word business.

The first Cross Word Puzzle Book was published on April 10th, 1924. In
New York it sprang into immediate popularity, becoming there a best
seller within a fortnight. A small but ardent group of cross word
puzzle devotees gave the fad a running start. Among these pioneers may
be mentioned F. P. A., Montague Glass, Neysa McMein, Emily Price Post,
Baird Leonard, Ruth Hale, Gelett Burgess, Robert C. Benchley, Hendrik
Willem Van Loon, Kathleen and Charles G. Norris, Mary Roberts Rinehart,
and Carolyn Wells.

Cross word puzzling became the thing to do, the raging topic of
conversation, supplanting Coué, Mah Jong, and Bananas (first a
slogan—now a fact!). With this impetus, the pastime’s popularity
radiated to other cities, and within a month the Cross Word Puzzle Book
was ranked No. 4 on the national list of non-fiction best sellers.
Three weeks later it advanced to third place, and the following month
jumped into the lead, where it appears to remain indefinitely.

First a fad, then a best seller, the Cross Word Puzzle Book became an
American institution, immortalized in cartoons by Briggs, prose-epics
by Bob Benchley, and ballads by F. P. A.

Ordinary books are meant to be read. Here is a book in which one
writes—more than that, a book in which one has the supreme satisfaction
of unravelling a real mystery, tracking down clue after clue. This, no
doubt, is the secret of the irresistible fascination of Cross Word
Puzzling. Every one enjoys being an amateur Sherlock Holmes—and the
tantalizing black-and-white word patterns provide an ideal
battle-ground for one’s detective instincts.

This deep-rooted appeal explains the extraordinary popularity of the
book. When we announced in one of our early advertisements that “people
do not want this book—they crave it!” we had actual proof to support
this statement—frenzied fans storming the publishers’ office to get
extra copies in order “to keep peace in the house.”

Six weeks after the publication of the first Cross Word Puzzle Book—May
18th, to be precise—the Cross Word Puzzle Association of America was
formed at a convention at the Hotel Ambassador, New York. At this
congress the rules and regulations of Cross Word Puzzling were
formulated. A contest for the cross word puzzle championship of the
world was held, and William A. Stern II won first honors, solving a
standard eleven-square formation in 10 minutes, 10 and two-fifths
seconds. Mr. Stern has written a preface for this book, explaining the
delights of cross word puzzling, for both novice and veteran.

Thus, in the words of Neal O’Hara, America began to gasp for words. The
Cross Word Puzzle became the Great Escape from Boredom—the most
powerful enemy of ennui....

Not only entertainment and thrills, but sound instruction reward the
true Cross Word Puzzler. Here is the most delightful and the most
effective way of building up one’s vocabulary and enriching one’s
general fund of information. Dictionaries and synonym books joined the
best seller list, right behind The Cross Word Puzzle Book itself, for
every one, to obtain the maximum benefit and fun, must have a
dictionary or a word book handy.

The pencil and eraser provided with The Cross Word Puzzle Book proved
to be a most popular feature. Post cards for applying for the correct
answers to the puzzles also pleased the followers of the pastime. This
equipment, therefore, is retained in the Second Series. The suggestion
has been made that future editions of the book be equipped with
shock-absorbers and four-wheel brakes.

Thousands of puzzle enthusiasts have indicated their eagerness for this
second series of cross words. This book, like the first volume, is
edited and compiled by the Cross Word Puzzle Editors of the New York
World, the undisputed leaders of the gentle art. Every effort has been
made to safeguard the technical perfection of the puzzles. This time
they are arranged in the order of their difficulty, beginning with
fairly easy ones, and ranging to the most intricate formations,
calculated to baffle Houdini himself. Beauty of design, accuracy of
definition, complete interlock, and the minimum number of unkeyed
letters—these elements have all been considered in selecting the
puzzles. We are confident that they will prove as absorbing, as
entertaining,—yes, as exciting,—as the first fifty.

PREFACE

By William A. Stern, 2nd Cross Word Puzzle Champion of the World


Two years ago I saw a friend of mine earnestly studying a checkered
diagram in the magazine section of a Sunday newspaper. Curiosity
impelled me to ask him whether he had taken up cross-stitching, because
the pattern he so zealously pored over resembled closely that of an
old-fashioned sampler. When he explained that he was attempting to
solve a puzzle I laughed, because in my ignorance I believed that
puzzles were childish time-wasters. I snorted my disdain at this sort
of balderdash and, angered, he challenged me to try my hand at it.

I confidently predicted that I would easily solve the foolish enigma
and after he had explained the manner of solution I set to work. A few
minutes later I started asking questions. What was one supposed to do?
My friend explained a second time and I was all at sea. Finally I
understood what to do, but was shaky on how to do it. I finished that
puzzle the next day. I gave little thought to food and rest; in the end
I triumphed.

Since that time I have solved many cross word puzzles but on none have
I consumed as much time as on that first heart-breaker. I used to blame
my slowness on the fact that the method was never properly explained,
but I now believe that my friend who gave me my first cross word
baptism was an adequate instructor. The chief difficulty which the
uninitiate meets lies in the struggle to concentrate on the
explanation. In their simplest terms here are the rules and technique
of cross word puzzling:

The primary object of the game is to fill up the blank spaces in a
cross word design with letters which spell out words. The solver
guesses the words from their definitions. By looking at a pattern we
can tell how many letters are in a word to be guessed. Suppose, for
example, you were asked for a six letter word meaning unsteady. You
would go through all the synonyms for unsteady that you could recall.
You would discard unstable, shaky, tipsy, tottering and rocky because
none of these words has the proper number of letters. You would accept
groggy or fickle. Now apply this system to the solution of a puzzle.

The definitions of the words are shown in two divisions: one division
is captioned Horizontal, the other Vertical. Before each definition is
a number which indicates that the word defined has its first letter in
the square of the same number on the pattern. For example, in the
puzzle on the jacket of this book (which is Number 1 in the book
itself), we see under Horizontal, “1. stout.” This means that the word
is read horizontally and starts in the space numbered “1” on the
pattern. The answer is “plump.”

A word always runs from its first letter to a black square or to the
end of the diagram. Having the word “plump” written in, we now have
hints of a certain letter in each of four other words, because each of
the letters in this word, except the letter “L,” is used to form a word
which is read downwards. Under the heading Vertical may be found the
definitions of the words which read downwards. So we see that the
letters in plump are used in the words prove, up, map, and plant. The
letter “L” is called in cross word parlance an unkeyed letter because
it does not give the solver a key to another word. Well constructed
puzzles have few unkeyed letters. You will notice also that all the
words in the puzzle are joined together or interlocked so that after
guessing the first word the solver may decode the entire puzzle without
once being minus a hint of some sort.

I do not mean to infer that these puzzles must be so constructed that
the solver has a simple task. An object of crosswording is to puzzle,
but fairness to a hard working puzzler dictates certain laws for the
designer to follow. The first of these laws is the all-over interlock.
The second is that in obsolete, rare, and unfamiliar words no letter
should be unkeyed.

And now a few words as to technique. Of course I prefer my own method
to any other, but I do not claim for it greater merit than the systems
I will tell you about. When I get a puzzle to solve, my first move is
to read all the definitions. Among these I am sure to find some
familiar and overworked words which I can set into place and be off to
a flying start. Certain simple three letter words such as bog, fen,
pen, boa, emu, and roc, and other words in which vowels pre-dominate
such as opera and arena are used in hundreds of puzzles. I get these
out of the way in short order. My next move is to start working on that
part of the puzzle where I have filled in the largest number of words,
because it is there that I have the greatest number of hints. If I
strike a snag I immediately take up my work in some other place. And so
I work my way around to completion.

Some people obtain excellent results by another method. They first do
all the horizontal words which quickly come to mind. And then all the
vertical. Thus they get an excellent start from which to work. Some
solvers use the system of building up from the first word which they
can guess.

Just a few words of warning:

First—Beware of putting in certain words whose definitions do not
accurately define. Parts of the verb “to be,” personal pronouns,
exclamations, notes of the scale, prefixes, suffixes and prepositions
should not be filled in unless an interlocking word gives you a hint as
to what they are. They are so numerous that without a hint it is futile
to attempt to guess them.

Second—Beware of homonyms. A homonym is two words which have the same
sound, but have different meanings. The best illustration of a homonym
appeared in F. P. A.’s column, the Conning Tower, a few years ago.
According to my feeble memory the sentence ran, “If I should say that
you are prone to carp, I would not mean that you are lying face
downward to a deep sea fish.” How often does the solver struggle over
such a definition as “light,” believing all the while that he must find
a word meaning an illuminant, when the correct word is “airy”!

Third—Beware of sloppy printing and careless erasing. When you write in
a word, letter neatly. Do not make a P look like an R. And when you
find it necessary to erase be sure to obliterate every letter. Dangling
characters which rubber crumbs have failed to pick up have cost so many
wasted hours that experts in efficiency have taken up the matter in
executive session.

Whatever method you employ or whatever mistakes you make, you will reap
pleasure and profit for your time. You will increase your vocabulary,
give yourself mental discipline, and, above all, you’ll have fun.

I want to thank the Plaza Publishing Company, whose real name is Simon
and Schuster, for its work in getting out these Cross Word Puzzle
Books. Most of the puzzles are of the first rank and the variety of
design is amazing. In fact I feel so kindly toward the publishers that
I do not upbraid them for the time they made me lose by a few errata in
the first edition, which they promptly corrected in the later editions.
I can heartily congratulate any owner of this Cross Word Puzzle Book
and all the Cross Word Puzzle Books to follow on the days of real
pleasure that lie before him.

There are two essential points that must be remembered by initiates
into the cross word puzzlers’ fraternity. First, the numbers in the
squares refer to the definitions; secondly, there should be but one
letter to each white square.

Figure 1 shows a cross word puzzle challenging each and every one of us
to solve it. Looking the puzzle over we find that 1 horizontal calls
for a seven letter word meaning “disparage.” That is not so easy, so we
leave it temporarily. We go on to the next one, which is a three letter
word meaning “a cereal grass.” What else could it be but OAT? Therefore
we ink in OAT in the proper squares. “Vice Admiral.” That most
assuredly must be VA. We place that into position. The ninth, tenth and
eleventh do not come to our minds immediately, so we pass them up. We
will catch them on the cross check. Twelve is familiar, however, and
with a little thought we place LO in the vacant squares. The rest do
not come to us, so we leave them also, and turn to the verticals.

                  Fig. 2

Looking over the diagram (See Figure 2) we find that one vertical calls
for a seven letter word whose third and fifth letters are V and L
respectively and which is defined as “evolve.” The V and the L give us
the clue. The word is DEVELOP. We place it in the diagram. Two, three
and four are easy, for we have three clues to work on and we find the
proper words without much difficulty. The next one is beyond us, so we
go on to the one numbered 8. We find that a three letter word—starting
with A—meaning “gone by,” is needed. The clues of A and O enable us to
get that without much trouble, and we place AGO in the square. We pass
by nine, but thirteen is easy. “A male sheep?” Why, of course, the word
is RAM.

From now on the going is easy. We have plenty of clues to the words
that we do not know. (See Figure 3.) Rechecking the horizontals, we
find that we have the first, third, fourth and fifth letters of
“disparage,” and with their aid we easily see that the word is DETRACT.
Looking for a two letter word meaning “an edge-tool,” we soon find that
there is but one word that will fit. We place AX in position. With nine
vertical beginning with an A it is easy to find that ARE is the proper
word. Ten horizontal proves to be EGG and eleven becomes ART. We say to
ourselves that if we could only get five vertical we would have the
puzzle solved. Well, why not? Is the second letter an a, e, i, o, or u?
The definition gives it as “a web.” What word will fit but TEXTURE? We
place that into position. Now, we find that we have the puzzle almost
completed. Fifteen horizontal needs a three letter word meaning
“impair.” Its middle letter must be an A. With the A to guide us that
is simple. The word is “SAP.” Fifteen and sixteen being two letter
words are easily found, and we place SO and PI into position. We now
find that we have the puzzle completed with one exception. Seventeen
horizontal has to be found. Its first, third, fourth, fifth and seventh
letters are P OMI E. A consonant is needed for the second letter, and R
seems to be the most logical choice. That gives us the word, which is
defined as “agreement.” (See Figure 4.)

We settle back into our chair with a sigh of content at the thought of
a job well done. But that is not the finish. Rather it is but the
start. Now that we have tasted the pleasures of cross word puzzling, we
are loath to give our time to anything else. What other amusement
offers the pleasure, instruction and satisfaction that is to be found
in Cross Word Puzzles? There is but one answer to that question,
and—foregoing the movies—we settle down to the elusive task of tracking
words to their lairs.








DO’S AND DON’T’S FOR SOLVERS


Don’t get scared if you can’t guess the first horizontal word. Go
through the list till you find a definition that you’re sure of. That
is the simplest method of beginning the solution. When you have written
in all the words you are sure of, you will have plenty of clues for the
unknowns.

Don’t spent too much time with the long words unless you are sure of
them. They will appear when the short ones have been solved. Of course,
not all the short ones are easy, but they are generally more readily
attended to than the long ones. Also, there are more of them,
increasing the chances of finding familiar faces among the definitions.

If you think a word is right, pencil it in lightly till you are sure.
This saves erosion of paper and temper. But never hesitate to try a
word that may be right. The trial and error method holds in puzzling as
it does in life.

Remember that the horizontals furnish a sure check on the verticals,
and vice versa.

If you are hopelessly stuck, try another puzzle. Inspiration sometimes
waits for a return engagement.

A pleasant feeling of something attempted, something done, accompanies
the solution of a cross word puzzle. It’s good for the inferiority
complex.








PUZZLE NO. 51

MADE IN A RATHSKELLER

A Duet


Two of the editors went out to lunch one hot day, with this result. By
the way, this pattern is the same on which the puzzle for the World’s
Championship was made up. Can you do it in ten minutes, ten and
two-fifths seconds? That was the time it took William A. Stern II to
win the championship.

SEVEN GREEK CROSSES

We counted the half-crosses to make up Mr. Sirich’s grand total. Please
note: no unkeyed letters, no abbreviations or contractions, and
comparatively few two- and three-letter words. Also double interlock
throughout. Io triumphe!

PUZZLE NO. 58

BOOLA BOOLA

By Hassler Whitney


Considering how often the convenient “eli” finds its way into Cross
Words, it is quite right to include this puzzle from New Haven. It is
undoubtedly meant for freshmen, for despite a loose center and several
unkeyed letters it shouldn’t be too difficult.

PUZZLE NO. 59

AT EASE

By John Fasel


If you are angry and want something to fight with, don’t try this one.
It won’t give you much of a wrestle—that is, if you are one of those
hard-boiled solvers. But if you haven’t reached the state of complete
addiction, or if you merely want a fillip, Mr. Fasel’s construction
will please you.

PUZZLE NO. 60

NOT TOO HARD

By Saul Berman


This constructor built a form that gave himself a lot of two-letter
words. Are two-letter words permitted in English? They are. But there
are only a few of them in existence and, consequently, they are
repeated often.

PUZZLE NO. 62

PLAN OF CAMPAIGN

By Mordecai M. Richter


This looks like the plan of a fortress. Like a fortress of the true
medieval type it has four massive corner ramparts, towers, battlements.
The enemy might be tempted to pierce those thin side indentations, but
remember the military strategy about the danger of getting into pockets
and being trapped.

PUZZLE NO. 64

LULLABY

By Hugh P. Evans

construct,” is the way the song sometimes should go. It is hard to keep
inside a small dictionary.

PUZZLE NO. 65

QUIET COMFORT

By Marcam


This one stays close to the amenities of English. There are few words
you don’t use, if your vocabulary is as ample as a cross word puzzler’s
should be. By the way, has your vocabulary expanded since you’ve
started puzzling?

PUZZLE NO. 66

DIAMONDS WITHIN DIAMONDS

By Isis


Plenty of trouble ahead here for the unwary solver. The four-letter
word border is a tricky thing to monkey with, for often the wrong word
contains the same number of letters and answers the definition
perfectly. A good many unkeyed letters, but none in critical places.

PUZZLE NO. 67

A STAID FORM

By Charles Erlenkotter


This plot of crosses and dots looks safe and conservative. There are,
however, several perfectly good English words that will give you a
thrill. By strange coincidence, this odd pattern was used by another
contributor and will be found elsewhere in the book. A comparison of
the two puzzles will be interesting.

PUZZLE NO. 69

LOOSELY WOVEN

By John Boyajy


The warp and weft of this one are not drawn too tightly together. If
the puzzle has a fault, it is in the abundance of black squares, but
the neat interlock saves it. Rather easy for the adept, and not an
undue tax on the novice.

PUZZLE NO. 70

A STUDY IN CROSSES

By Daniel O’Leary


Funny how often you find crosses in cross word puzzles. There are
several meanings to that. You will observe Maltese crosses in Mr.
O’Leary’s construction, and it isn’t hard enough to make you cross.

PUZZLE NO. 71

WATCH THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER

By Marcam


One of the editors, being tempted to solve this one in the proof, found
it smooth, consistent sailing throughout, save in the lower left hand
corner. This section probably isn’t hard at all. Wonder how you will
find it. You know how a pair of absurdly easy words will stump you now
and then.

PUZZLE NO. 72

ROUND AND ROUND

By Persephone


The double round of blacks outlines four good corners and a center
which, while bearing an unenviable five-spot, would have been virtually
impossible of construction without it. The unkeyed letters should not
cause any trouble.

PUZZLE NO. 73

MY SECOND AND LAST

By Joseph A. Margolies


“This is my second and last,” writes J. A. M. “Too absorbing. Leaves no
time to read.” We don’t believe J. A. M. He underestimates the frailty
of the human soul where cross word puzzles are concerned. He’ll be at
it with ruled paper and pencil again, and then he’ll swear off again.

PUZZLE NO. 74

QUADRICRUCIFEROUS

By A. C. R.


Twenty-four unkeyed letters—but no two, and only four three-letter
words and a splendid all-over interlock. Not more than average
difficult, but not more than medium easy. The long words form splendid
spinal clews—if you get them.

PUZZLE NO. 75

LOCKED UP TIGHT

By Gregorian


An all-over double interlock with a triply-locked center and corners.
Probably considerably easier to solve than to construct. The words are
weak in spots, but the construction passes the few obsoletes.

PUZZLE NO. 77

TRY THEM OVER IN YOUR DAILY CHAT

By Irvan Neckerman


There are several dozen words in this puzzle that you can use and your
best girl won’t know what you are talking about. This is not misogyny.
It merely supposes that she does not follow cross word puzzling. Or
maybe that is misogyny.

PUZZLE NO. 79

WEDDING RING

By Mil-Wal


The contributors of this construction are husband and wife. This fact
is symbolized by the wedding ring you see in the middle of the form.
Cross-grained cross worders may complain that the ring is not a solid
mass of words. Well, is a ring ever a solid mass?

PUZZLE NO. 82

THIRD-RAIL CROSSOVER

By I. S. O.


A fine double-cross study in four-letter words. The occasional
abbreviation does not mar the general effect. The lateral wedge-masses
key well with the central cross. Altogether a nice construction.

the interlock.

PUZZLE NO. 85

DIRTY WORK AT THE CROSS WORDS

By Neophyte


Perhaps you agonized over Neophyte’s creation in the First Series.
Here’s its mate. Neophyte, being a hardened veteran of the cryptic art,
must have heard the groans from the breasts of puzzlers poring over his
brain buster. And he gloated and went at his fell work again. However,
this one is a little easier than the other.

PUZZLE NO. 86

HEY, THERE!

By Neophyte


Dear Neophyte: Whaddaye mean by those two bare, indecently naked words,
each with three unkeyed letters? An expert like you? However, you tried
too hard to keep it down to the level of ordinary mankind and
restrained yourself from so many outlandish words that you are addicted
to—that, we believe, the puzzlers will forgive you.

PUZZLE NO. 87

SPOT

By Irvan Neckerman


The blacks strewn negligently over the form give it an informal look,
different from those forms that are studiedly ornamental and almost
forbidding in the courtly, mannered preciseness. However, Mr.
Neckerman’s construction may make you knit your brows now and then.

PUZZLE NO. 88

CENTRIFUGAL

By Minerva

motion. Then try and solve it, and see if the rotary motion doesn’t
transmit itself to your head. Plenty of short words, but not all of
them easy, and the long ones—but go ahead!

This is no Falstaff of cross word puzzles, no paunchy fellow stuffed

PUZZLE NO. 90

CORNERED

By T. J. Stephens


Look at those corners, full, compact, ample, obese. A little bit loose
on the sides, but admirable for corner construction. Most constructors
would run the arms of the central cross out to the next to last letter.

PUZZLE NO. 91

THAT EXCLUSIVE LINOLEUM PATTERN

By Wilmer H. Koch


Mr. Koch wandered into the kitchen after a doughnut, and saw black and
white squares all over the floor. “Aha,” thought he, “like a flash, an
idea!” This is it.

PUZZLE NO. 92

ADAM’S RIB

By E. Pinkerton


If this puzzle were Adam, that central double armed cross would be his
rib just before it started turning into Eve. We observe nice fat masses
of words at sides and corners.

PUZZLE NO. 93

IN THE CLOVER PATCH

By Minerva


A splendid construction, particularly in its avoidance of the bane of
puzzlers—the loose center. Minerva has not hesitated to call upon the
deeps of the dictionary for her words; there are some old favorites in
the patch, of course, but also some interlopers that will serve to keep
your interest for some time.

PUZZLE NO. 95

MODERATION

By Porter R. Lee


Never too much of anything is the slogan of this constructor. He gives
you a puzzle of moderate difficulty, but a set of easy words and then a
terror hidden among them like a serpent in the grass. The puzzle runs
its way at an even tenor, like an honest man’s life.

PUZZLE NO. 97

A CRISS CROSS

By Jack Barrett


Only eight unkeyed letters in this, so you’ll jolly well have to fill
in every white square before the struggle is over. You may chew an inch
off your pencil before you finish, though.

PUZZLE NO. 98

A NINE-CELLED HIVE

By Edith S. Iseman


There is plenty of verbal honey in the nine divisions of this
construction, and your search is not likely to result in any stings.
The central interlock, perhaps, might be improved upon, but there! We
have built puzzles ourselves, and know what the constructor is up
against.

PUZZLE NO. 100

A HARD NUT TO CRACK

By J. T. D.


Get out nutcracker, hammer, tongs and poker, for there are words in
here that the English language doesn’t know it owns. J. T. D. is
absolutely ruthless when it comes to cornering the odd and unusual
word, and the unheard-of definition. This puzzle is included especially
to show you to what lengths the innocent Cross Word can go when it
tries.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
